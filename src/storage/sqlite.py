"""SQLite storage for course documents.

The main table, ``course_document``: a row per course holding the full JSON.
The document is the only source of truth and is rewritten whole on every sync.
Dated items are queried out of the JSON with ``json_each`` rather than
duplicated into a second table.

Beside it, ``account`` holds a single row: who the last login was, and which
Moodle it was against. It is the one fact the course documents cannot carry,
because they are keyed by course and the person is not a property of a course.

``manual_status`` holds what the student said about an activity that Moodle
cannot know: "I handed this in elsewhere". It is the one table no sync writes,
so it is carried across the drop a sync starts with -- see ``CourseStore``.

Within one sync, writing is an upsert and never a delete: a course that stops
appearing keeps its old ``last_seen_at``, which distinguishes an unenrolment
from a failed fetch. Across syncs that distinction is currently moot, because
``fresh=True`` drops the file first and every run starts from an empty table.
