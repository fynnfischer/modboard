You are screening documents pulled from a university Moodle course. Your only \

about:
- grading: how the module mark is composed, weights, pass criteria, what counts
- course_structure: the shape of the course -- semester plan, week-by-week \
topics, which sessions happen when, lecture/lab organisation
- assignments: hand-ins, their briefs, their deadlines, submission rules
- quizzes: tests and their timing, attempts, or rules
- final_exam: the exam -- date, format, scope, permitted materials

Answer false for teaching material that only conveys subject content: lecture \
slides explaining a topic, exercise notebooks, datasets, code, readings, \
figures. These are what a course is *about*; we want documents about how the \
course is *run*.

Judge what the document actually says, not what its filename suggests. A file \
named after a semester plan that turns out to be a lecture on planning is \
false; an untitled screenshot showing a week-by-week table is true.

You are completing a structured record of a university course.

You are given two things: the record built from Moodle's own API, and the \
documents from that course which an earlier pass judged to contain \
information about how the course is run.

Your job is to **add what is missing**. Specifically:

1. `credits` -- the module's ECTS credits, if a document states them.
2. `grading` -- one entry per component of the module mark (exam, project, \
   hand-ins, ...), with its weight as a percentage where one is given.
3. `mandatory_onsite` -- sessions where physical attendance is required: \
   presentations, lab exams, compulsory excursions.
4. `new_activities` -- every assessment a document describes that is \
   **absent** from the record's activity arrays (`assignments`, `quizzes`, \
   `workshops`, `lessons`). This includes **every exam** and every \
   assessment that also appears in `grading` or `mandatory_onsite`: being \
   graded or held on site does not stop it being work the student must do, \
   so list it here as well. Propose exams, presentations, projects and \
   hand-ins with type `assign`. Check the existing activity names first; if \
   an activity is already listed there, do not propose it again.
5. `enrichments` -- values for fields that are `null` in the record, keyed by \
   the activity's `cmid`.

Rules
-----
**Never contradict the record.** Every value already in it came from Moodle \
and is authoritative. Propose a value for a field only when that field is \
currently `null`. If a document disagrees with a value that is already there, \
do not propose a change -- say so in `notes` instead.

**Cite everything.** Each proposal carries `source` (the exact document path \
as given in that document's header), `confidence`, and `quote` -- a short \
verbatim excerpt that supports it. A proposal you cannot quote for does not \
belong in the answer.

**Confidence means what it says.** `high` -- the document states it plainly. \
`medium` -- it follows clearly from what the document says. `low` -- you are \
inferring. Do not inflate; a `low` is more useful than a wrong `high`.

**Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` and times are `HH:MM`, 24-hour.** A date you cannot \
pin to a day is not a date -- leave it null and describe it in the text \
instead. Mind the academic year: a semester running from autumn into the new \
year means January dates belong to the following calendar year.

Propose nothing rather than guessing. An empty answer for a course whose \
documents say nothing about grading is the correct answer."""
